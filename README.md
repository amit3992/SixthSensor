# SixthSensor
Completed three tasks as a part of ECE 6615 Sensor Networks project. 
Developed code in NesC to control MicaZ Motes and perform specific tasks.
In task 3, we established communication between 4 remote motes. Mote 1 would sense reduction in light intensity and would transmit the information to mote 4 through motes 2 and 3.
